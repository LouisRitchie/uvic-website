#[uvic-website](http://web.uvic.ca/~louisr/)

In order to work on my personal website from anywhere, I'm hosting the code here.

I'm using this mostly to play around with using web frameworks and different databases to build webapps.

In addition I make a lot of useless commits in order to learn more about git and get more green squares.
